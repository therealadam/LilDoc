# Lil' Doc

**Find your way through your words.** A plain text editor where search isn't a feature—it's the foundation.

A little document-based app for working with plain text using modern macOS systems.

## It's all about search

- Type some stuff into the doc
- There's always a small search field at the bottom of the document window
- You can do search-based navigation, previous and next, based on the contents of the search field
- As a bonus, the text in the search field is highlighted in the text document
- Besides that, it's a Real macOS app – you can use services, Writing Tools, etc.
