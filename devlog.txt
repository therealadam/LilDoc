This is the story of Lil' Doc.

🥅 Size up Amp's capabilities and affordances.
x Make the default window size a golden ratio close to the aspect ratio of this current window.
x Compose an icon for the application based on the idea of search.
- When hitting cmd-g/cmd-shift-g to move between matches, also move the cursor.
- Add a 'jump back' button next to the up/down arrows. When next/previous match are used, the jump back button remembers the last cursor position before jumping to a search match and then returns to that position.
- The search should only match instances that are surrounded by space. So "the quick -fox jumps" would not match but " - the quick fox" and "- the quick fix" would match because "-" is surrounded by whitespace or is proceeded by a newline/return.
- Save the search text between sessions.

The application is born. Of a very small idea in service of tackling a much bigger one.

The good news is, we're $0.41 in and we have a working concept for an application.

We're free-writing/coding here.

I should define, for the agent, some jargon:
* the match object:
* the search value:
* jump back:

🐛Using search causes the highlighted text, cursor, and insertion point to interact oddly. It looks like the insertion point remains after the highlighted text, regardless of where the cursor is. Rolled the prev/next keybind changes back, at least we're in a good position.
