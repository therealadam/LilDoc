# Good Lil' Dev Log

This is the story of Lil' Doc.

🥅 Size up Amp's capabilities and affordances.
The application is born. Of a very small idea in service of tackling a much bigger one.

🔧Functionality
x Make the default window size a golden ratio close to the aspect ratio of this current window.
x Compose an icon for the application based on the idea of search.

The good news is, we're $0.41 in and we have a working concept for an application.

We're free-writing/coding here.

I should define, for the agent, some jargon:
* the match object:
* the search value:
* jump back:

🐛Using search causes the highlighted text, cursor, and insertion point to interact oddly. It looks like the insertion point remains after the highlighted text, regardless of where the cursor is. Rolled the prev/next keybind changes back, at least we're in a good position.

At this point I have an mediocre little $1.50 app. Plus human labor. I wonder how much extra, in hourly/human rate, it would cost to get this into the App Store at this point. 🤔

Back at it, with a fully powered Amp agent this time. I'm up to a $3 text editor.
x Hitting cmd-f should focus the search box. Hitting enter or escape within the search box should move the focus back to the text editor.
x When hitting cmd-./g/cmd-shift-g to move between matches, also move the cursor _and_ insertion point.
x Revise the icon to fit into the macOS Tahoe design language, as it were.

Going with a very skeumorphic icon design. Glass and flat design be-damned. And a Swiss app design, overall. But, I'd like a monospace font.

Overall, Amp is pretty great at iterating on smaller functionality. Probably time to figure out how I 

x Revise the app design for a more "Swiss" look, e.g. Byword or Stash

## Demo script

This is another "Bobcat" experiment.
It's actually the third, but I'll come back to the second one.
I should have called this one Lil' Bob🍔, but Lil' Doc is fine and not too on the nose.
The original idea here is to reduce my document editor ideas down to something really simplistic.
(I have a bigger idea brewing, but wanted to 
This is about $6 of tokens in Amp. 

----

- Save the search text and cursor position between sessions.
- Try harder to restore the cmd-f to search functionality.
- Maybe move the search field, current search object, and prev/next functionality into an overlay. Only show the document in normal mode. Basically, there is editing mode, there is search mode. Maybe navigation is part of search/navigate mode?
- Add a 'jump back' button next to the up/down arrows. When next/previous match are used, the jump back button remembers the last cursor position before jumping to a search match and then returns to that position.
- The search should only match instances that are surrounded by space. So "the quick -fox jumps" would not match but " - the quick fox" and "- the quick fix" would match because "-" is surrounded by whitespace or is proceeded by a newline/return.
- Make a build I can easily test locally without being inside the development cycle. e.g. a `.app` bundle in ~/Applications.
