# Good Lil' Dev Log

This is the story of Lil' Doc.

🥅 Size up Amp's capabilities and affordances.
The application is born. Of a very small idea in service of tackling a much bigger one.

🔧Functionality
x Make the default window size a golden ratio close to the aspect ratio of this current window.
x Compose an icon for the application based on the idea of search.

The good news is, we're $0.41 in and we have a working concept for an application.

We're free-writing/coding here.

I should define, for the agent, some jargon:
* the match object:
* the search value:
* jump back:

🐛Using search causes the highlighted text, cursor, and insertion point to interact oddly. It looks like the insertion point remains after the highlighted text, regardless of where the cursor is. Rolled the prev/next keybind changes back, at least we're in a good position.

At this point I have an mediocre little $1.50 app. Plus human labor. I wonder how much extra, in hourly/human rate, it would cost to get this into the App Store at this point. 🤔

Back at it, with a fully powered Amp agent this time. I'm up to a $3 text editor.
x Hitting cmd-f should focus the search box. Hitting enter or escape within the search box should move the focus back to the text editor.
x When hitting cmd-./g/cmd-shift-g to move between matches, also move the cursor _and_ insertion point.
x Revise the icon to fit into the macOS Tahoe design language, as it were.

Going with a very skeumorphic icon design. Glass and flat design be-damned. And a Swiss app design, overall. But, I'd like a monospace font.

Overall, Amp is pretty great at iterating on smaller functionality. Probably time to figure out how I 

x Revise the app design for a more "Swiss" look, e.g. Byword or Stash
x Make a build I can easily test locally without being inside the development cycle. e.g. a `.app` bundle in ~/Applications.

## Demo script

This is another "Bobcat" experiment.
It's actually the third, but I'll come back to the second one.
I should have called this one Lil' Bob🍔, but Lil' Doc is fine and not too on the nose.
The original idea here is to reduce my document editor ideas down to something really simplistic.
(I have a bigger idea brewing, but wanted to shore up my collaborating-with-agents workflow first.)
This is about $6 of tokens in Amp. 
What I've learned:
* Amp, it's pretty good. Like it says on the tin, an opinionated stew of good ideas about how a coding agent should work.
* Collaborating with an agent on building a single-platform (macOS) application is much easier than trying to target multiple platforms via Catalyst.
* There are lots of fiddly bits to get right once you start trying to daily a document editor like this.
* But, you can't really know whether progress or something good is being made unless you can find a reason to daily drive your work. Eventually, I'll need to find an excuse to use this.

I've done plenty of building today, so maybe some research.
So we find ourselves in a world where micromanaging a little robot to do the typing and researching of code and figuring out how to solve problems is basically real.
🤔Typing with my voice (via Whisper Transcription) seems like a logical step to take this expedition. At least the agent writing or agent working part.

An attempt to make the search dialog both more Liquid Glass-y and better functioning is not going well. Possibly I need better prompts. Or, to not remark to myself how well this whole agent thing is going. 🙃

I wonder why the line-height varies so much in this here not very customized macOS document editor. 🫠

Why am I self-conscious about working "with my voice" while Courtney is around? Because it seems extra, or nerdy, or just unconventional?

## Feb 5, 2026

I kind of got bored about this one pretty quickly. 
First, because I quickly fell off a cliff where I could not easily prompt Amp to change the UI in the way I want
And, amp was often making mistakes with introducing bugs in how the system worked or was unable to find those bugs. 
Anyway, the amp was a great zero-to-one pair, but not a one-to-two collaborator. 

Second, I think an editor built for moving around in notation like Canon Cat is interesting but of limited utility to my actual uses. 
In reality I'm always going to be using a Bear or Things or Day One or Ulysses. 
some kind of pretty dang good markdown editor
I'm not going to try and replace or supllant those. 

So I think the next step is to pursue developing a notation system of my own within those other ecosystems. 
For example in veins or in bare patch symbols that I can search through and find quickly. 
And maybe encode that notation and navigate through it with system automation, like short cuts, or Apple scripts, or Raycast, or something like that. 
So you know kind of building low road software in this next prototype kind of feels like the next step. 

That said, I would like to return to the idea of a notation, a rule-based notation editor just to build that for fun, 
which is kind of what I had in mind to build in the first place when I built Lil Doc
it would be a useful experiment to see if I could get past that quality cliff and produce what I think is a small scope but high quality macOS application.


(Dictated to Whisper, while music is playing 🙃)

Back at it, still with Amp.
Maybe it's worth seeing through what $20 of purchased credits, plus daily quotas, might get me.
Or, what I might learn.

`amp review`, it's pretty good!
Has it fixed the line-height issues? It's looking good so far. That's kinda impressive, that I didn't even need to give it a screenshot to get that done. You go, little machine.

* Fix the line-height inconsistencies in the text editor

A (public) Github repo was finally created. Working with the garagae door open!
Kinda the funnest part of working with Amp is vibing on the Painter mode. Maybe I should dig deeper on image generation. 🤔

----
- Save the search text and cursor position between sessions.
- Try harder to restore the cmd-f to search functionality.
- Maybe move the search field, current search object, and prev/next functionality into an overlay. Only show the document in normal mode. Basically, there is editing mode, there is search mode. Maybe navigation is part of search/navigate mode?
- Add a 'jump back' button next to the up/down arrows. When next/previous match are used, the jump back button remembers the last cursor position before jumping to a search match and then returns to that position.
- The search should only match instances that are surrounded by space. So "the quick -fox jumps" would not match but " - the quick fox" and "- the quick fix" would match because "-" is surrounded by whitespace or is proceeded by a newline/return.
- re-imagine the current app icon/logo as a one-stroke drawing
- re-imagine the search interface as an modal overlay
